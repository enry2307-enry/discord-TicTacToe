# Discord TicTacToe BOT
Hello, this is the source code of a Discord Python Bot developed using discord.py library. 
This bot is meant to host TicTacToe games with easy commands and a friendly UI.

## Features
 - Lobbies of maximum of two players: you can quit anytime the lobby.
 - Friendly UI ( discord messages with emdeds )
 - AFK Timer (temporary down): when atleast 1 player is afk during the game for atleast two minutes the game gets canceled. The same happens when there's only one player in the lobby: if he waits for atleast two minutes lobby gets reset.

# New Update Version 0.1 ( in branch version.0.1 )
You can now play in every server, every channel. What matters is that one channel can host only one game. Same user can play multiple games in multiple channels/servers.
During this update AFK Timers have been disabled due to integrading channels into the bot. In the next update afk timers will be working again.

Feel free to help if you would like it!
