# Discord TicTacToe BOT
I am creating this Discord bot to play TicTacToe!

## Features
 - Lobbies of maximum of two players: you can quit anytime the lobby.
 - Friendly UI ( discord messages with emdeds )
 - AFK Timer: when atleast 1 player is afk during the game for atleast two minutes the game gets canceled. The same happens when there's only one player in the lobby: if he waits for atleast two minutes lobby gets reset.
### Limitations and future updates
 - Games can only be played in one server and in one channel per time
 - I have no host either budget to put the bot online
 - Using interactions only instead of commands

Feel free to help if you would like it!
